# Single Post

Since for blog I've used dynamic routes, you can find the source of code in `pages/blog/[slug].tsx`

The single post using a specific layout (blogLayout) that located on `_layouts/blogLayout.tsx`.

In **blogLayout** you can see the CSS and single post codes.

## Writing

At the root of the directory, you can see the `blogs` folder where you can make a blog post with `mdx` type or put your mdx file here.

### Writing Structure

The single post has 2 section:

1. Front matter

Front matter allows page-specific metadata and functionality to be included at the top of a Markdown file.

![yaml|contain](/images/blogs/documents/blogs-tags/yml.png)

The above image is an example of front-matter for this theme.

```
---
title: <your-title>
description: <your-description>
publishedAt: <publish Date 'MM-DD-YYYY'
tag: <your tags> → this must be an array like: ['Document', 'Getting Start']
cover: <name of your cover> → you need to put your cover in public/images/<your-path>
author: <your-name>
tableOfContent: <Enable/Disable table of content> → on is Enable and off is Disable.
---
```

2.  Body

The body is markdown that support the mdx, MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content.

for example:

```
<div
  style={{
    padding: '1rem',
    backgroundColor: 'darkOrange',
    borderRadius: '10px',
    color: 'white',
  }}
>
  <span>This is a test for MDX</span>
</div>
```

**Output**

<div
  style={{
    padding: '1rem',
    backgroundColor: 'darkOrange',
    borderRadius: '10px',
    color: 'white',
  }}
>
  <span>This is a test for MDX</span>
</div>

### Local Image and Cover

Generaly images located on the public directory. This theme has a special discipline to keep the structure clean for images.

We assume that the name of our blog post file is `hello-world.mdx` and the name of image is `cover.png`

- Example 1:

<div style={{border: '2px solid green', padding:'1rem', marginBottom:'1rem'}}>
<div
  style={{
    color: 'green',
  }}
>
  blog post is under `blog` directory
</div>
So we need to move the images used for hello-world.mdx to this directory:`\public\images\blogs\hello-world`

then our image path will be: `\public\images\blogs\hello-world\cover.png`

</div>

- Example 2:

<div style={{border: '2px solid green', padding:'1rem', marginBottom:'1rem'}}>
<div
  style={{
    color: 'blue',
  }}
>
  blog post is under `blog\documents` directory
</div>
So we need to move the images used for hello-world.mdx to this directory:`\public\images\blogs\documents\hello-world`

then our image path will be: `\public\images\blogs\documents\hello-world\cover.png`

</div>

![yaml|contain](/images/blogs/documents/blogs-tags/local-image.png)

The structure for this blog post is:

Blog structure

```
blogs
└── documents
    ├── blogs-tags.mdx
    ├── getting-started.mdx
    ├── menu.mdx
    └── pages.mdx
```

According to the structure of the blog, the structure of our image will be as follows:

```
public
├── images
│   └── blogs
│       └── documents
│           ├── blogs-tags
│           │   ├── cover.png
│           │   ├── local-image.png
│           │   └── yml.png
│           ├── getting-started
│           ├── menu
│           └── pages


```

> Image syntax: `![yaml|contain](/images/blogs/documents/blogs-tags/local-image.png)` ![object-fit|contain](/images/blogs/documents/blogs-tags/object-fit.png)

> I've used a component for modify img tag . the component name is `MDXCompoenet.tsx` that located on `_includes/MDXCompoenet.tsx`

### External Image

For external image, you need to add the hostname of your URL to the `images.domains` config in `next.config.js`:

Ex: we modify `images.domains` for 'unsplash.com' & 'pexels.com' as follow:

```
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  images: {
    domains: ['unsplash.com', 'pexels.com'],
  },
};
```

# Single Tag

The single tag is generated automatically, the source code of tags located on `pages/tag/[slug.tsx]`.

The single tag page lists posts that have same tag. (You wrote the tags on the front matter of the blog post.)

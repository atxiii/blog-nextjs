# Header

The code of Header located on `_includes/header.tsx`

The header has 3 section:

- Logo
- Menu
- Darkmode

## Logo

The code of logo located on `_includes/navbar.tsx` line **83**

![logo|contain](/images/blogs/documents/menu/logo.png)

Current Logo is a svg that located on `_includes/icons/logo.tsx`, I've used svg because we can control fill color for `Darkmode` option.

if you want use png/jpeg or other types you can replace code to this:

```

<Image
  alt="Home"
  src={resolvedTheme === 'light' ? '/logo.png' : '/dark-logo.png'}
  layout="responsive"
  width="277"
  height="109"
  priority={true}
/>

```

## Menu

The code of menu located on `_includes/navbar.tsx` line **89**

You can set your menu in `config/config.yml`

![logo|contain](/images/blogs/documents/menu/menu.png)

## Darkmode

The code of Darkmode located on `_includes/navbar.tsx` line **117**

You can disable the Darkmode option in `config/config.yml`.

> darkMode: 'off'

# Footer

At the `config/config.yml`, you can find the footer text.
